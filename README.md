# web-scraping-challenge
 The goal of this project is to build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information on a single HTML page.

There are two parts to the project. The first part is scraping, where Jupyter Notebook is used to grab NASA Mars news title, news paragraph, featured image URL, Mars Hemispheres titles, and URLs from https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/, https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/,  and, https://mars.nasa.gov/

The second part of the project is to use MongoDB and Flask to store and present the data that are scraped in a single HTML page.
